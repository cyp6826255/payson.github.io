# Apple Enterprise Account Registration Process

## 1. Prepare an Apple ID

 Use a non-owner account. An Apple ID that has never held an Apple developer account will do, even if it has been added as an administrator.

## 2. Complete Real-Name Registration

 Use the Develop app -- Apple's official developer app. Log in to the Apple ID you want to register. Go to -> [Account] and click [Register Now].

## 3. Register

 When registering, you must enter your personal real-name information, not your company information.

If the address verification fails multiple times and the Register button remains grayed out, you'll need to contact Apple Developer by phone to resolve the issue. My experience: after removing my restrictions in the backend, I entered my company information again, which resulted in another error. This second error couldn't be removed, so I had to send back my ID card for verification. Once verification was successful, the Register button was enabled again.

## 4. Real-Name Authentication

I clicked Register and saw a membership fee of 688 yuan per year. Confused, I contacted Apple Developer again. After further remote assistance, I was able to proceed past the "Next" button after "Register" and continued to "Next" until I completed the ID card and facial recognition, completing the real-name authentication.

## 5. Enterprise Account Registration

 At this point, if you have a personal account or a regular enterprise account (688 yuan/year), you can register here. Enterprise accounts (299 US dollars/year) require you to return to the website to register.
