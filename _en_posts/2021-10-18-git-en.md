## 1. General multiple accounts

Multi-account SSH configurations between different host code warehouses. There's a lot of information online. [Configure multiple SSHs](https://www.jianshu.com/p/92d207964061)I don't know.

## 2. Multiple Github accounts

As a result of applying for multiple domain names, there was an anomaly in the Gitpage under the same github account, probably because of CNAME or something. Attempts to reapply for a Github account to be managed separately would also be helpful.

The previous account number github was configured with ssh, and the new account also tried to be configured with ssh.

Regenerated new ssk-key and configured config files

```
# github2
Host a.github.com
Port 22
User a
HostName github.com
PreferredAuthentications publickey
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github_a

# github 
Host b.github.com
Port 22
User b
HostName github.com
PreferredAuthentications publickea
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github_b

```

Code for clone b repository, hint when the code is submitted

```
ERROR: Permission to B/payson.github.io.git denied to A.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```

The default account was A at the time of submission.

And if we change to B, the public key will be fine, and Config will be fine.

Last look at the data found that there was a need to change Host.

Remote Host of Repository B plus config configured b.github.com

```
origin:git@b.github.com:b/payson.github.io.git
```

To match Host with Config's Host
