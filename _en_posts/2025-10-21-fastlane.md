## 1、Preface

​	I've always used a self-built CI/CD pipeline. While its advantages are flexibility and adaptability, it also comes with path dependencies. The downside is that it's difficult to maintain. After discovering Fastlane, I discovered that this process can be implemented in different ways.。

## 2、Contrast

​	Traditional CI/CD is more process-oriented, with step-by-step instructions for: dependency retrieval, compilation and build, product archiving, and distribution. For more details, see my other article ["Building a Pipeline in Practice"](https://paysonchen.cn/zh/%E6%9E%84%E5%BB%BA%E6%B5%81%E6%B0%B4%E7%BA%BF%E5%AE%9E%E8%B7%B5/).

### 2.1、[Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) 

​	**Fastlane** is an automation tool for building, testing, deploying, and releasing iOS and Android apps. It simplifies the tedious release process by automating tasks such as certificate management, building, packaging, and uploading to the App Store and Google Play. Through a series of command-line tools and configuration files, developers can efficiently manage the app lifecycle, saving significant time and effort.


#### 2.2、Install Fastlane

First, make sure you have Ruby installed, then install Fastlane using the following command:

```
sudo gem install fastlane -NV
```

Or：

```
brew install fastlane
```

------

### 2.3 Initial Fastlane

In the project root directory, run the following command to initialize the Fastlane configuration

```
fastlane init
```

Fastlane  will guide you to choose an automation workflow, such as **iOS** or **Android**, and create a corresponding configuration file (such as `Fastfile`)

------

### 2.4 Config `Fastfile`

In `Fastfile`, you can define multiple automated lanes, each lane corresponding to a task. For example, you can create a lane for building and uploading to **App Store**。

For example：

```
default_platform(:ios)

platform :ios do
  desc "自动化构建并上传到 App Store"
  lane :beta do
    increment_build_number  # 自动增加构建号
    build_app(scheme: "MyApp")  # 构建应用
    upload_to_testflight  # 上传到 TestFlight
  end

  desc "发布到 App Store"
  lane :release do
    increment_build_number
    build_app(scheme: "MyApp")
    upload_to_app_store  # 上传到 App Store
  end
end
```

#### Explain：

- `increment_build_number`：Automatically increments the build number。
- `build_app`：Builds the app。
- `upload_to_testflight`：Uploads the build to **TestFlight** (can be used for beta testing).。
- `upload_to_app_store`：Uploads the build to the **App Store**。

------

### 2.5 Exec Fastlane

You can execute these automated tasks by running the corresponding lane：

#### beta ：

```
fastlane ios beta
```

#### release ：

```
fastlane ios release
```

Fastlane will automatically complete tasks such as building, uploading, and version management according to the steps defined in `Fastfile`.



------

## 3. Summarize

**Fastlane**  simplifies the release process for iOS and Android apps by configuring automated tasks using Fastfiles, from build to release. It's particularly well-suited for CI/CD environments, significantly improving development and release efficiency.
