When the RN reports the following errorï¼š

```

 resolve try the following:

  1. Clear watchman watches: `watchman watch-del-all`.

  2. Delete the `node_modules` folder: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`. 

 3. Reset Metro Bundler cache: `rm -rf $TMPDIR/react-*` or `npm start -- --reset-cache`. 

  4. Remove haste cache: `rm -rf $TMPDIR/haste-map-react-native-packager-*`.

```

It might be because the RN and React versions do not match.



```

yarn add react-native

```

Check the warning

```

warning "react-native > use-subscription@1.5.0" has unmet peer dependency "react@^17.0.0".

warning " > react-native@0.63.3" has unmet peer dependency "react@16.13.1".

```

The react dependency version needs to be added.
